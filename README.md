# axiome-extensions
BETA personal scripts to extend or improve AXIOME functionality

Copyright Jackson M. Tsuji, 2017

Brief description of each script (more documentation coming!)
- `axiome_length_dist.sh`	Shows the length distribution of the reads merged by PANDAseq, to look for potential errors in the read merging process.
- `mesas-pcoa_JMT.R`	Improved PCoA plotting script, for use in RStudio
- `mesas-pcoa_JMT-cl.R`	Improved PCoA plotting script, for use in command line. Effectively a replacement for the original script.
- `otutable_subset.R`		Makes a subset of the OTU table (e.g., to top 1%)
- `otutable_taxaplot.R`		Makes a taxa plot of the OTU table (like the MetAnnotate barplot script)
